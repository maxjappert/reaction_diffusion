# Reaction Diffusion

This is an implementation of the reaction diffusion algorithm [as described by Karl Sims](https://karlsims.com/rd.html) in Processing. Reaction diffusion simulates two liquids with different properties
mixing over time. There's a natural elegance about how this system evolves. It bares similarity to the patterns on the fur of certain animals, as well as other observable natural systems.
